LUCK is the Linux Unified Key Steup volume encrypted via asymmetric asymmetric


Firstly we need to use findaes.exe (https://sourceforge.net/projects/findaes/)
if you use linux,you need to run with wine.

wine findaes.exe memdump.dmp 
Searching memdump.dmp
Found AES-128 key schedule at offset 0x6ae8c80: 
b4 c6 07 d5 93 f2 67 7b f6 3f d1 2e 54 89 ce ac 
Found AES-128 key schedule at offset 0x6ae8e80: 
c2 2a 94 fa b6 ef d8 15 e5 62 9a e4 75 7a 57 89 


now you can see the key but you need to change  this hex to binary i will use xxd

echo "c22a94fab6efd815e5629ae4757a5789" | xxd -r -p > key1
echo "b4c607d593f2677bf63fd12e5489ceac" | xxd -r -p > key2

next step is to mount the other dmp file with losetup 

sudo losetup /dev/loop2 disk.dmp

Next is we will decrypt with this volume with the above keys

sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/loop2 switch --master-key-file key1
Cannot read 32 bytes from keyfile key1.

sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/loop2 switch --master-key-file key2
Cannot read 32 bytes from keyfile key1.

Our above keys can't read so i think we need to combine these two keys
cat key1 key2 > key3
cat key2 key1 > key4 

and next decrypt this volume with key3 
sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/loop2 switch --master-key-file key3

Bango!!! You can decrypt this volumne now.

mount thie decrypted volume 

mkdir /tmp/luks
sudo mount /dev/mapper/switch /tmp/luks
ls /tmp/luks 
flag.txt 

NOw you got the flag.txt and read it.
Coucou!
J'espère que tu as apprécié ce petit challenge :)

Voilà ton flag: ENSIBS{No_n33d_v0lat1l1tY_w1th_AES_kEys_1n_m3morY}
